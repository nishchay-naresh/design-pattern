# Design Principles

####    SOLID

**S - Single Responsibility Principle**
    
“One class should have one and only one responsibility”
**O - Open Closed Principle**

“Software components should be open for extension, but closed for modification”

**L - Liskov’s Substitution Principle**

“Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types”

**I - Interface Segregation Principle**

Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.
Don't create fatty interface, Implementation classes require to implement unnecessary methods
 
**D - Dependency Inversion Principle**

Dependency Inversion principle states that:
1.	High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
2.	Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

####  Few More Design Patterns

**1. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

Avoid code duplication

**2. Encapsulate what changes**

Hides implementation details, It will help in maintenance

**3.  Favor Composition over Inheritance**

Code reusability without cost of inflexibility

**4. Code to Interface**

Helps in maintenance, improve flexibility

**5. Delegation Principle**

Do not do all the stuffs by yourself, delegate it.



# Design Patterns

This repository is having the code implementation for below Design Patterns


Types of Design Patterns
1. Creational Patterns - Deals with the process of creation of objects of a class.
2. Structural Patterns - deals with objects and arrangement of objects (IS A, HAS A)
3. Behavioral Patterns - concerned with communication between objects.


4. J2EE Patterns - specifically concerned with the presentation tier



### 1. Creational: 

1.	Singleton
2.	Builder
3.	Prototype
4.	Factory
5.	Abstract Factory

### 2. Structural: 

6.	Adapter
7.	Façade
8.	Decorator
9.	Proxy
10.	Flyweight
11.	Composite
12.	Bridge


### 3. Behavioral: 

13.	Observer
14.	Chain of Responsibility
15.	Visitor
16.	Command
17.	Strategy
18.	State
19.	Iterator
20.	Mediator
